            <h3>Welcome to Iron Atom Studios</h3>
            <p>
                What started as a few ideas scribbled and sketched on the back of a church program in a backwater Idaho congregation grew into ideas that have become a part of us.  We spent most of high school telling each-other these stories, and now we are developing them to bring them to you.  We began by creating the most cliché and basic heroes we could think of and thought it a good irony.  In a time of deconstructing superheroes, that was hardly a novel idea, but as we worked on these characters, we came to realize that there is a reason that people resonate with larger than life heroes.  We want someone that we can look up to.  We want dynamic examples that inspire us to reach out and achieve our potential.  Superman and Batman have led the way for the last 90 years (enduring all efforts by cynics to tear them down) because  they provide just that kind of inspiration.  Spiderman has similarly seen immense popularity over the years for both his ability to strive for a higher ideal, as well as to be relatable to normal people in a human experience.   We have embarked on a quest to bring to life characters who are flawed and human, but who similarly strive for that ideal, but with just a twinge of dark humor.

                Our first graphic novel, Chronicles of Heroes takes place on the world of Diametros and follows the adventures of a morally ambiguous scoundrel on a quest to rid himself of a curse.  Join Kade Wilson (no relation to Slade or Wade) as his journey embroils him in a struggle that will determine the fate of gods and humanity alike.  Will he grow as a person? Will he marry the princess?  Will he give up and resign himself to a long and very cursed existence?  Read the first six pages of his adventure here.

                Prefer unending despair and dark nihilism?  We’ve got that covered as well!  To a Dreamer is an illustrated book of poetry and short stories by the godfather of eldritch horror himself. Crafted lovingly by some of the most talented artists on the internet, we delve into some of Lovecraft’s lesser-known works.  Journey into Despair, find out what has been happening to The Cats of Ulthar, explore The Garden, or walk The Ancient Track.  Discover (or rediscover) these timeless tales of gloom and darkness as well as many others here.

                Nostalgic for the 80s and 90s era of action films that shot first and asked questions never?  Do you miss the days when stories like Terminator and Blade Runner were the norm?  Do you miss masculine heroes and beautiful heroines?  Step into the dystopian future of earth where men are at war with machines in a fierce bid for survival, but still find time to pull pranks on each-other and fistfight in the training yard.  Still in the early stages of development, Soldier Boys is our love letter to futuristic, dystopian science fiction, and a re-work of our first ever printed comic book.  Find details here.
