      <h3>Iron Atom</h3>

        What started as a few ideas scribbled and sketched on the back of a church program in a backwater Idaho congregation grew into ideas that have become a part of us.  We spent most of high school telling each-other these stories, and now we are developing them to bring them to you.  We began by creating the most cliché and basic heroes we could think of and thought it a good irony.  In a time of deconstructing superheroes, that was hardly a novel idea, but as we worked on these characters, we came to realize that there is a reason that people resonate with larger than life heroes.  We want someone that we can look up to.  We want dynamic examples that inspire us to reach out and achieve our potential.  Superman and Batman have led the way for the last 90 years (enduring all efforts by cynics to tear them down) because  they provide just that kind of inspiration.  Spiderman has similarly seen immense popularity over the years for both his ability to strive for a higher ideal, as well as to be relatable to normal people in a human experience.   We have embarked on a quest to bring to life characters who are flawed and human, but who similarly strive for that ideal, but with just a twinge of dark humor.

        Our first graphic novel, Chronicles of Heroes takes place on the world of Diametros and follows the adventures of a morally ambiguous scoundrel on a quest to rid himself of a curse.  Join Kade Wilson (no relation to Slade or Wade) as his journey embroils him in a struggle that will determine the fate of gods and humanity alike.  Will he grow as a person? Will he marry the princess?  Will he give up and resign himself to a long and very cursed existence?  Read the first six pages of his adventure here.

Journey into Despair, find out what has been happening to The Cats of Ulthar, explore The Garden, or walk The Ancient Track.

Do you miss masculine heroes and beautiful heroines?  Step into the dystopian future of earth where men are at war with machines in a fierce bid for survival, but still find time to pull pranks on each-other and fistfight in the training yard.

      <h3>Chronicles of Heroes</h3>
      <p>
        Kade Wilson is no common skeezball.  He is an exceptional skeezball.  After stealing from an old gypsy woman, he kills her to escape her service and is instead cursed to carry her bones and spirit with him until the end of his days.  His singular mission is now to find a way to break the curse before Babs drives him insane.  He encounters Lana, a princess desperate to escape her silk prison and see the world.  Together they blunder through a world on the brink of war and annihilation.  Through it all, Kade never loses sight of is priorities--himself, and Lana when he can be bothered.

      <h3>To a Dreamer</h3>
      <p>
        For better or for worse, the name H.P. Lovecraft is inseparably connected with the horror genre, and in particular with Eldritch Horror.  His works, while at times controversial, helped shape the mythos surrounding modern horror fiction.  While he is best known for his Cthulu Mythos, he was a prolific author and poet with over 70 stories to his name.  Most of the attention to his works has been paid to the aforementioned mythos, but here we have endeavored to bring some of his other works to the forefront.  Below is a sample of brand new artwork created specifically for these shorter works.
