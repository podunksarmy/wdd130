        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I just got married last month and am currently celebrating my honeyoon (long story).  I am from Marsing, Idaho, but I am looking to move to Rexburg this year with my wife to study computer science.  I am really looking forward to being able to learn about web development, as my brother and I are comic book creators and we have a convention coming up in April.  We currently don't have a website, and while I am interested in learning how to do this anyway, one of my big motivations this semester is to see if I can craft us a website worthy of our comics.
            I don't have much programming or web building experience, but I did take HTML back in 8th grade, and I remember loving it then.  It has really come back to me as I've started to learn about it again 20+ years later.
